# swbf-name-changer

Can be used to change your in-game name for Star Wars Battlefront Multiplayer without changing the name in Steam/GOG.
Start SWBF Name Changer.
Run SWBF and proceed until you see the Serverbrowser. 
Then change your desired name.

- You can close the SWBF Name Changer after you joined a server.
- Changing a name after joining a server does not work.
- Once back in the Serverbrowser you can change your name again.
- Your name is stored in a txt file in your home directory (SWBF-Name-Changer.txt).
- Supported characters:
    - Definitely supported are [basic latin](https://unicode-table.com/en/#basic-latin) characters (from 21 - 126).
    The input field of the GUI does only support those.
    - Some characters beyond that range work if you write them into the text file (127 - 879).
